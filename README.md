ðŸ“Œ ## Project Overview
As an aspiring Data Analyst navigating the current job market, I developed this interactive dashboard to gain a comprehensive understanding of the global landscape for data-related roles in 2023. The goal of this project was to move beyond simple job listings and create a centralized tool that answers critical questions for any data professional in training or on the job hunt.

This dashboard is designed to help users, especially aspiring analysts and job seekers, to:

Identify the most in-demand job roles within the data industry.
Understand salary expectations and benchmarks for various positions.
Discover which countries have the highest demand for data professionals.
Recognize the most popular platforms for finding data-related job opportunities.
Gauge the key skills required for different roles, particularly for data and business analysts.
ðŸ’¡ ## Key Insights
From the 26,712 job vacancies analyzed, several key trends emerged:

High Demand, Lower Salary for Data Analysts: The Data Analyst role shows the highest demand across the globe. However, it also has the lowest median salary among the technical data roles analyzed, suggesting it's a common entry point into the field.

Top Skills for Analysts: For Data and Business Analyst roles, a core set of skills is consistently in demand: SQL, Excel, Python, and Tableau. This highlights the foundational tools required to enter the industry.

Leading Job Platform: Ai-Jobs.net emerged as the most-used platform for posting data jobs, surpassing larger, more generalist platforms like LinkedIn.

USA Leads the Market: The United States has the highest number of job postings, indicating it is the largest and most active market for data professionals.

Specialized Roles Command Higher Salaries: While demand is highest for general analyst roles, more specialized positions like Senior Data Scientist ($150K) and Senior Data Engineer ($148K) command significantly higher median salaries.
